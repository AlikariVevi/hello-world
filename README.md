# hello-world
This is my hello-world repository

I am a programming enthusiastic and I wish to collaborate with other to create interesting things.

I received a bachelor's degree in Physics from University of Athens and went on continuing my studies as a PhD student in Cosmology with University of Aegean. During my studies I felt a need to widen my mathematical knowledge and I am currently enrolled in the BA program in Mathematics of University of Aegean. I am also finishing a master's degree in Ocean Science and Technology with National Technical University of Athens.
